  pitch: `I have been working with software development for over 10 years and I am good at solving hard problems.<br/>
  I have always been a curious person, one that is not satisfied until I discover how things work. I do that by breaking things (problems) into smaller things (parts of the problem) until I get a good picture of the whole situation. And then I tackle problems and I strive to solve them in an efficient and user-friendly way. I try to build simple, clean and effective solutions, rather than making complex and fragile solutions.<br/>
  I also have a business mindset and I focus on making your users happy and you profit more. User satisfaction is important and so it is that a business is profitable and healthy. And those are aspects that are my focus.
  `,
